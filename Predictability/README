Can we predict the scale of information on online social network?
Functions:
1. create_ER_network: create ER network by given the size of network n and average degree d.
2. create_ER_network_with1super: create ER network with a super node, which means its number
    of neibors is proportion to the size of network n.
3. create_SF_network: create scale free network by given n, k_min, k_max, gamma.
4. configuration_network_by_cumPk:  generate network A and degree list by given cum Pk and n.
5. configuration_network: generate network A by given degree list.
6. bond_percolation: simulate bond percolation in a network A given p.
7. site_percolation: simulate site percolation in a network A give p.
8. giant_component: calculate pinf for a network A after bond/site percolation.
9. giant_component_dist: calculate the distribution of the size of component after percolation.
10. giant_component_dist_node: calculate the size of component for each node it belongs to.
11. calc_Pinf_dir: calculate pinf for a directed network A, include gscc, second gscc and gout.
12. plfit: fitting alpha given data x. x should be like a straight line in loglog.
13.plplot: plot data x and alpha.
14. belief_propagation: simulate belief propagation in a network A.
